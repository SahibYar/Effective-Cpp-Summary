## Chapter 1: Accustoming Yourself to C++
Regardless of your programming background, C++ is likely to take a
little getting used to. It’s a powerful language with an enormous range
of features, but before you can harness that power and make effective
use of those features, you have to accustom yourself to C++’s way of
doing things. This entire book is about how to do that, but some
things are more fundamental than others, and this chapter is about
some of the most fundamental things of all. 

[**Item 1:** ](https://sahibyar.gitbooks.io/effective-cpp-summary/content/chapter-1-accustoming-yourself-to-c-++/item-1.html) **View C++ as a federation of languages.**

[**Item 2:**](https://sahibyar.gitbooks.io/effective-cpp-summary/content/chapter-1-accustoming-yourself-to-c-++/item-2.html) <b>Prefer `consts`, `enums`, and `inlines` to `#defines`.</b>

[**Item 3:**](https://sahibyar.gitbooks.io/effective-cpp-summary/content/chapter-1-accustoming-yourself-to-c-++/item-3.html) <b>Use `const` whenever possible.</b>

**Item 4:** Make sure that objects are initialized before
they’re used.
