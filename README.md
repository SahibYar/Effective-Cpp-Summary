#### Declaration

A _Declaration tells compiler about the name and type of something, but it omits certain details. For Example:_

```cpp
extern int size;                         // object declaration
std::size_t numDigits(int number);       // function declaration
class Widget;                            // class declaration
template<typename T> class GraphNode;    // template delaration
```
